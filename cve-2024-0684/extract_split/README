The Dockerfile in this folder extracts the split.c file from the vulnerable coreutils version (9.2),
which is what is edited and then used to run the experiment. 

First build the file with following command:

docker build -t get_split .

And then copy the source:

docker run -v $(pwd):/output -it get_split cp /tmp/split.c /output/split.c
